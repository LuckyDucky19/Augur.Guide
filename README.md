Pg 1 - Introductory Mission Statement

_Versions of Reputation which do not correspond to the real-world outcome will become worthless, as no one will participate in prediction markets unless they are confident that the markets will resolve correctly. Therefore, token holders will select the only version of Reputation which they know will continue to have value: the version that corresponds to reality._

Pg 2 - Footer

_2 - An invalid market is a market determined to be invalid by reporters because none of the outcomes listed by the market creator is correct, or because the market wording is ambiguous or subjective_

Pg 11 - Section F

_F. Ambiguous or Subjective Markets Only events that have objectively knowable outcomes are suitable for use in Augur markets. If reporters believe that a market is not suitable for resolution by the platform – for example, because it is ambiguous, subjective, or the outcome is not known by the event end date – they should report the market as Invalid. If a market resolves as Invalid, traders are paid out at equal values for all possible outcomes; for scalar markets, traders are paid out halfway between the market's minimum price and maximum price. It is possible to imagine markets where some reporters are certain that the outcome is A and others are certain that the outcome is B. For example, in 2006, TradeSports allowed its users to speculate on whether North Korea would fire a ballistic missile that would land outside of its airspace before the end of July 2006. On July 5, 2006, North Korea successfully fired a ballistic missile that landed outside of its airspace, and the event was widely reported by the world media and confirmed by many U.S. government sources. However, the U.S. Department of Defense had not confirmed the event, as was required by TradeSports' contract. TradeSports concluded that the contract's conditions had not been met, and paid out accordingly.28 This is a case where the spirit of the market – to predict the missile launch – was clearly satisfied, but the letter of the market – to predict whether the U.S. Department of Defense would confirm the launch – was not. TradeSports, being a centralized website, was able to unilaterally declare the outcome of the market. If such a situation arises in an Augur market, REP holders may have differing opinions about how the market should resolve, and stake their REP accordingly. In the worst case, this could result in a fork where REP in more than one child universe maintains a non-zero market value._

It is up to _Reporters_ to decide what outcome is the correct version that corresponds to reality.  Here are some **Recommended Universe Selection Guidelines:**


<table>
  <tr>
   <td rowspan="6" >* INVALID
   </td>
   <td>The market is clearly trying to subvert the reporting system or scam traders/reporters. \

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>At market creation time, it was known that one or more of the outcomes will never payout.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The question is subjective in nature.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The outcome was not known at market end time.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The title, details and outcomes are in direct conflict with each other.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>There are strong arguments for the market resolving as multiple outcome
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
